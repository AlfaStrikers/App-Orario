<h4> A simple software for displaying my class's school schedule </h4>

For this project I used a component of Java, Swing, for graphical interfaces. The interface is very minimal, in the first window there are 4 buttons, which go to open a new window with the subjects of each week (1-4). The windows containing the subjects are in PNG format (yeah it sucks , I know, but it's my first project with graphical interfaces lol)
